# Prime Game

## Overview

This project is a Python implementation of a competitive game scenario that leverages concepts from prime numbers, game theory, and algorithm optimization. The challenge is to determine the winner of a game where two players take turns removing prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers. The player who cannot make a move loses.

## Concepts Required

### Prime Numbers

- **Definition**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.
- **Efficient Algorithms**: Understanding and implementing algorithms for identifying prime numbers within a given range.

### Sieve of Eratosthenes

- **Description**: An efficient algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a specified integer.
- **Application**: Useful for precomputing prime numbers to optimize the game logic.

### Game Theory

- **Basics**: Principles of competitive games where players take turns.
- **Optimal Play**: Understanding strategies that ensure the best possible outcome for each player.

### Dynamic Programming/Memoization

- **Description**: A method to optimize algorithms by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.
- **Application**: Helps in efficiently managing the gameâ€™s state across multiple rounds.

### Python Programming

- **Language Features**: Use of loops, conditional statements, arrays, and lists.
- **Game Logic Implementation**: Translating game rules and strategies into Python code.
