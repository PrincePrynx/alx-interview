# Coin Change Problem

## Project Overview

The **"0. Change comes from within"** project focuses on solving a classic problem from the domains of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms: the coin change problem. The objective is to find the minimum number of coins required to make up a given total amount, given a list of coin denominations. This project will help you apply your understanding of algorithms to devise a solution that is not only correct but also efficient.
